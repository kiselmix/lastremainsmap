        Be careful, zombies are attracted to noise! Crouch (press ALT) and move slowly, you won't attract them. First of all, to survive you need to find things in the building:
		<ul>
			<li>Weapons are stored in the kitchen</li>
			<li>Food and water in the refrigerator</li>
			<li>Medicines can be found in the bath</li>
		</ul>
		It's time to dare to leave the apartment! Listen to the sounds. If you hear zombie screams or people's footsteps, look through the peephole for safety. Zombies behind the door? Wait until his back is turned and kill him from behind with a sneak attack.<br> You're out on the street and it's time to learn the basic mechanics of the game.

        Your character appears on the second day. On the third day, a circle will appear on the map that will decrease over time. If you are outside the circle, you will not lose health. Just try to stay inside the circle to make it easier to escape.
		<br>On the fourth day, the helicopter will arrive somewhere in the circle area. Use the <a href="https://lrmap.fun/" style="color: #ffffff" target="_blank">Interactive Map</a> to see helicopter landing sites, look up and listen to the sound to find the helicopter. Remember that most players will be in this area trying to kill other players looking for the helicopter.
		<br>There are three seats in the helicopter! Therefore, only three will survive and keep the found NFTs, the rest will die.
		If the fourth day ends and you don't fly away, you will die. There is no fifth day!

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Basic indicators</h2>
        The main character indicators are Health, Food and Water.
		<br>Health is restored only with medications. In addition to the bathrooms, medicines can be found in pharmacies, hospitals, or kill the zombie-nurse.
		
		<br>If a character runs out of food or drink, his health will decrease until the character dies! Supplies can be found in stores, food vending machines or refrigerators. Find enough food and drink to survive until the fourth day.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Stamina - strategic element</h2>
        Stamina is spent from running, dashing, jumping or hitting. This gets replenished but if it runs out, it takes a long to be replenished. Can temporarily increase the maximum stamina reserve by using an energy drink, coffee, or eating a pill. 
		<br>If you run out of stamina, you won't be able to jump high, run slower and fight slower.
		<br>Make the enemy lose all their stamina, and then attack him. This will give you an advantage in battle.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Firearms</h2>
        In the game you can find a pistol, shotgun or machine gun. Find them:
		<ul>
			<li>In the closet (very small chance)</li>
			<li>Kill the zombie-policeman (small chance)</li>
			<li>Weapon room at the police station (small chance)</li>
			<li>Crashed helicopter. Only one on the map (100% chance)</li>
		</ul>
		Use your weapons wisely! If you start shooting, zombies will follow your shots everywhere, and other players will see your location on the map as a red mark.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">NFT</h2>
        NFTs can be found inside apartments in closets or nightstands. This is the most desired loot for all players. If you find an NFT, that's just the beginning! You definitely need to survive and fly away by helicopter. Only then will you become the owner of the NFT. 
		<br>Were you able to get the NFT from the game? Congratulations! Now you can:
		<ul>
			<li>Use NFTs as skins for clothes or items that give your character small bonuses</li>
			<li>Use NFTs in a mini-game <a href="https://www.lastremains.gg/search-and-rescue" style="color: #ffffff" target="_blank">Search & Rescue</a>. Stake your NFTs and get $ZT tokens and even more NFTs</li>
			<li>Sell NFTs. Use the official <a href="https://www.lastremains.gg/bridge" style="color: #ffffff" target="_blank">Last Remains bridge</a>, to transfer NFTs from Epic Games to Polygon and sell them on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/lastremainsequipment" style="color: #ffffff" target="_blank">Opensea</a></li>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Loot and regions</h2>
        The map is divided into 9 regions:
		<ul>
			<li><span style="color: #75d384">Yudu House</span>: Buildings 10-13. Good place to find loot if you are a beginner, as there are enough cabinets, the edge of the map and there are few people here. But if the area with the helicopter is far away, you will have to run!</li>
			<li><span style="color: #f77792">Hospital</span>: Buildings 20-22. In this area you can only find a food store (20) and a hospital with medicine (21-22). The hospital is very dangerous, there are a lot of zombies.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #cae264">Zi Yun Wan</span>: Buildings 30-35. Best place to find loot is a 31-story building with a bunch of rooms. Players strive to get into this area. Get ready for a fight.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #a4fffa">Shan Shuivilla</span>: Buildings 40-48. Good place for loot, lots of apartments and easy to find NFTs. But itâ€™s also the busiest place.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #e98fff">Old Town Apartments</span>: Buildings 50-56. Normal place to loot. There are a lot of rooms, but you have to run around a lot.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #f58631">Immortal's Pass</span>: Buildings 600-617. Below normal place to loot. But small buildings, you will have to move between houses along streets inhabited by zombies.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #19c1f3">Bai Xiang Residents</span>: Buildings 700-715. Bad place for loot. There are many floors and rooms, but few cabinets with NFTs. Some buildings don't have an elevator, and there are a lot of zombies on the stairs.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #00ff91">Crane and Pines Terrace</span>: Buildings 800-811. Worst place for loot. Small houses and few rooms. Better leave here for other regions.</li>
			<li><span style="color: #ffcb31">Goose Park</span>: No buildings. There is no loot to be found here, only food vending machines.</li>
